**Authors:** Forzana Rime (fkr206) & Mohammed Uddin (msu227)

## Instructions
1. Make sure input file names are in the form of Input_.txt (eg. Input1.txt, Input2.txt, etc.)

2. Input text files should contain nine rows of integers that contain the initial cell values of the game board, separated by blanks. The values ranges from 0 to 8, with 0 indicating a blank cell. 

3. Create an input and output folder. Then place your input files in the input folder, and make sure your output folder is empty. Currently, the program handles inputs located in the directory path "./input" and places output files in the directory path "./output". If you would like to change this, please update lines 8 and 9 of the source code. Please also make sure that the program is in the same level directory as the output and input folder.

4. Run the program in your terminal by using the command: python backtracking_search.py
